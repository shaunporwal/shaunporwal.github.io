Decision-analytic techniques allow assessment of clinical outcomes but often require additional information that may be cumbersome to apply to models that yield continuous results. Decision Curve Analysis is a method for evaluating and comparing prediction models that incorporates clinical consequences, requiring only the dataset on which the models are tested, and can be applied to models that have either continuous or dichotomous results.\nThe dca function performs decision curve analysis for binary and survival outcomes. Review the DCA tutorial for a detailed walkthrough of various applications.\n\n\n\n\nSites\n\n\nDecision Curve Analysis Site\n2023\nI made this site for my boss’ statistical method “Decision Curve Analysis”. This method is used to evaluate prediction models, molecular markers, and tests, based on clinical consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\nSite for UN NGO (1)\n\n\nSite for UN NGO (2)\n2023\nI made these sites for my contacts at the UN running NGOs.

    "text": "Getting to the point of having a decent site for myself was a very long and arduous journey. Unlucky for me, I never took any HTML/CSS/JavaScript classes and was starting from absolute 0. For someone who’s looking to contract it out and has a healthy budget, it can be smooth and seamless. Unfortunately, I have a knack for masochism, an engineering degree, and am always looking for ways to be frugal.\nThis journey all started when I saw the landing page for the statistical method my boss invented in all its glory (sarcasm). I had been tasked with creating its Python library, so I thought it a good idea to simultaneously make my first foray into front-end development and design an informational and instructional tool for users (https://decisioncurveanalysis.org/). Well-versed in R, I used basic CSS and Rmd files to render my R code into HTML and stored it in a GitHub repo, taking advantage of the GitHub Pages free hosting service.\nAt around the same time, I spun up a personal site in the same way, and reused a lot of the same simple code I used for my boss’s page. Needless to say, it was neither very functional nor aesthetic. I kept on iterating on it for months and months and before finally putting it down. I was actually so embarrassed by it that I stripped it of its contents and left a note saying ‘Under Renovation’.\nA short while ago I encountered someone on GitHub using the distill package in R to make their portfolio site, and it came out looking incredible. It fit the bill in terms of aesthetics and having a nice blog and ‘about’ page, but there were some functionalities that were indispensable for me. I really wanted a framework that could integrate R & Python code seamlessly for my data science projects. After much digging, I finally came across Quarto!\nQuarto is just so amazing. It fully supports Python & R integration, has a very spare, neat aesthetic, and the best part: It’s extremely simple to get up and running! This is the first time I’ve felt empowered rather than encumbered by my web framework!"
