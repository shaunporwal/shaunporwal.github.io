    "text": "Whenever you start doing something, whatever it is, you will be extremely far from efficient at it. I think it’s probably a law of the universe. There are also fundamental concepts in machine learning called ‘loss functions’ and ‘gradient descent’ which are analogous to the same phenomenon in humans. The basic idea is that we know there’s a fundamental truth, or something to aim for. We take iterative steps towards the goal, and eventually either we end up at the goal, or we become extremely efficient at achieving it. There is the concept of optimizing towards a ‘local minima’ and getting stuck there, and also the fact that sometimes we learn things that are counterproductive in which case our progress more closely resembles ‘stochastic gradient descent’, but we won’t get into that for now.\nLet’s take this blog as an example. The last 2 posts I wrote are steaming hot trash. I was basically just trying to churn out my thoughts and get into the groove of writing. I tried to articulate myself around 2 topics I was thinking about, and used lots of language I cringe at when I go reread. The style also seems overly formal and the pieces are not too captivating in my perspective. I feel like the tone in this post, however, is closer to what I’d like to maintain on this site. It’s personable, has a flow of consciousness feel to it, and relates disparate ideas in a haphazard way. As a person, I’d say that’s way more representative of who I am as opposed to being focused on a singular topic and rusty with the words I like to use.\nAnyways, around 3-4 years ago, I was asked at work to build a Python package by my boss. Initially, not only did I know nothing about Python packaging and open source, I also knew embarrassingly little about Python. I was fresh out of my Master’s degree and very much green around my ears and everywhere else. I started following this dude named neuralnine on YouTube, and his python packaging video was the first thing I ever saw on the subject (YouTube Link). He used twine and some other tools in a rudimentary way to get something up on PyPI.org very quickly. It didn’t have any of the bells and whistles I use today, but it worked, which in hindsight is massive.\nHis workflow I probably used for a good while, maybe around 2 years or so, before I was introduced to more experienced people in the field who integrated CI/CD and Poetry, for example, and automating all of the testing. It was when I was using the old workflow that I had people sending me messages about how they’re using my package and like my implementation, and that they’d like this improvement or that bugfix. Case in point:\n\n\n\nUser feedback on my Python package\n\n\nAfter several years of maintaining and improving the package I made, now I have a very fast, headache-free workflow that has allowed me to build something that can cater to a larger audience. I was shocked to learn this, but my package recently hit 25k downloads! Have a gander at pepy.tech:\n\n\n\nDownload Count for my Python Package\n\n\nYou always see those shows on [insert your favorite media platform] where the main character goes through a period of hardship or training in order to gain some new power or ability. I feel like the hardships of making this package over the past few years have allowed me to refine my package-building and programming workflow to such a degree that things which would have taken me days or weeks to do previously now take seconds. This is the level of efficiency you can achieve in programming if you put your attention in the right places.\nFor anyone who’s read this far, you deserve this present. Here is the GitHub actions file I’ve generated after much trial and tribulation: GitHub Link.\nThis automates testing on different Python versions, pushing to test.pypi, pypi, and can easily include linting and generating a documentation site. I would have murdered to have had this a few years ago.\nFor all things local, please use Poetry, which is currently far superior to astral-uv. This is my hottest take currently. Poetry is tried and tested, and worked seamlessly, albeit much more slowly, for the entire packaging workflow. With uv I felt like I was passing the largest kidney stone known to man when I was trying to push packages to pypi/test.pypi."

    "text": "Getting to the point of having a decent site for myself was a very long and arduous journey. Unlucky for me, I never took any HTML/CSS/JavaScript classes and was starting from absolute 0. For someone who’s looking to contract it out and has a healthy budget, it can be smooth and seamless. Unfortunately, I have a knack for masochism, an engineering degree, and am always looking for ways to be frugal.\nThis journey all started when I saw the landing page for the statistical method my boss invented in all its glory (sarcasm). I had been tasked with creating its Python library, so I thought it a good idea to simultaneously make my first foray into front-end development and design an informational and instructional page for users (https://decisioncurveanalysis.org/). Well-versed in R, I used basic CSS and Rmd files to render my R code into HTML and stored it in a GitHub repo, taking advantage of the GitHub Pages free hosting service.\nAt around the same time, I spun up a personal site in the same way, and reused a lot of the same simple code I used for my boss’s page. Needless to say, it was neither very functional nor aesthetic. I kept on iterating on it for months and months and before finally putting it down. I was actually so embarrassed by it that I stripped it of its contents and, for a long time, left it bare with a note saying ‘Under Renovation’.\nA short while ago I encountered someone on GitHub using the distill package in R to make their portfolio site, and it came out looking incredible. It fit the bill in terms of aesthetics and having a nice blog and ‘about’ page, but there were some functionalities that were indispensable for me. I really wanted a framework that could integrate R & Python code seamlessly for my data science projects. After much digging, I finally came across Quarto!\nQuarto is just so amazing. It fully supports Python & R integration, has a very spare, neat aesthetic, and the best part: It’s extremely simple to get up and running! This is the first time I’ve felt empowered rather than encumbered by my web framework."

    "title": "Why I Will Never Put Outside Punctuation Inside Quotes",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Have you ever heard of the rule that certain punctuation around quotes should be inside the quotes? For example:\nHe said, 'I always follow the rules,' in a sanctimonious tone.\nor:\nShe replied, 'You should think for yourself.'\nIn the first example, we see that there is a comma right before the closing quotation mark, and in the second there’s a period in that same spot. Why is that? It turns out it’s a U.S. standard. From the colonial era around the 17th century until the late 20th century, printing text required manual typesetting using metal to imprint ink on paper. Commas and periods outside the quotes were a challenge in those days, and so it became common practice to keep them inside for aesthetics. This makes no sense to perpetuate now. We are far removed from manual typesetting, and including in quotes punctuation that doesn’t belong there only serves to distort source material one would wish to share.\nEven before I knew this was a vestigial practice from several hundred years ago, it just made total sense to put the punctuation on the outside, and I believe this type of purposeful disobedience says a ton about one’s character. In the same vein, the lack of this disobedience actually says volumes more.\nIf you see something you don’t agree with but you’ve been taught differently in the past, and there are no consequences for making either of 2 choices, if you choose the one that was taught to you solely because of that fact, is that not but a sign of cowardice and laziness? Maybe it’s the engineer in me speaking, but if you’re so easy to control and influence, and you completely lack the critical thinking to make an easy decision on the fly, I believe you are part of the entropy that seeks to bring all of existence to chaos.\nIt’s crazy I see sheep-like behavior everywhere. Maybe it’s my RAS (reticular activating system) which has gotten good at identifying sheepism. Just the other day I went on a run with my friend, and afterward we stopped by a falafel/schwarma joint to refuel. I wanted to avoid excess carbs and increase the protein content, and so I asked the server/cashier if I could get a slightly customized order. I wanted rice on the side which my friend was going to eat, and the main dish to be just the salad and protein. He couldn’t wrap his mind around deviating from the menu, and said that he was not allowed to do that. The main platter dish came with rice, salad, and protein. He could remove the rice but would still charge the same price, and could add it as a side which would increase the price of the new order to 150% of the original one.\nBecause we weren’t big fans of the food for the price and nutritional content, they did not get our patronage which could have been easily won. Mind you this place was basically deserted, and was not fancy. It’s not like they were unable to accommodate deviations. The dude could not cater to a very simple request and lost easy business.\nOf course we could be cynical and suppose that he wasn’t an owner of the establishment, and he was just saving himself the hassle. In that case, he would be a subpar employee who is not thinking in the best interest of his employer. Him not doing his best would be a poor decision in a series of poor decisions that led him to giving dissatisfactory service at a job he is not fond of. Whether it’s his inability to think outside the box or his laziness, it’s sheepism at play—and it’s precisely why I will never include unnecessary punctuation inside my quotes."

    "text": "How did this all begin? If you look at my GitHub, you’ll see a sea of black in 2024 followed by a relatively abrupt yet sustained wall of green. What’s not shown is that in 2024 I ran ~1400 miles, towards the end of which I ran the NYC marathon. My life was in a large part consumed by jogging around Central Jersey and Manhattan.\nI kept up a daily running streak for many months, and only broke it after facing extreme sickness that necessitated going to the NYU Langone Emergency Department to face the most intense pain I’d ever felt in my entire life. At my peak last year I was running 60 miles/week, and on one of those weeks I nearly ran the entire perimeter of Manhattan (~24/31 miles).\nIn Q1/Q2 of last year, I found myself in North Carolina attending a family friend’s wedding. At the wedding I was introduced to a student at UNC Chapel Hill. Upon sharing my hobby with her, she told me I should look into the Tarheels 10-miler, which would take place around 10 hours later, the morning of the next day. Registration was closed, but I showed up anyway, PR’ing in the 2-mile, 5k, and 10k, all in the same race.\nAfter the marathon in November, I stopped running. I traded in exercise for House M.D. & Attack on Titan, binging them among other content every moment outside of work. I had decided to follow what my body and mind were telling me, which was to cease 95 percent of my prior socializing and spend time alone.\nThen, one day, my friend invited me to swim and sauna, and I obliged. We finished up, and I suddenly felt a wave of energy and a sense of inspiration to do something productive. I wanted to build, and I wanted to meet up with my other close friend. A few moments later we found ourselves at the Bryant Park library in a quiet area working on our individual projects. In that session I finally created a presentable personal site for myself.\nIt was hard to focus. For over a month I had been binging shows and lying around, and my brain was not in the habit of focusing on a task for more than a few minutes. Come to think of it, my productivity was lacking the whole year outside of running, and I was getting sick at the frequency of around once a month. Maybe running was draining precious resources my body needed to focus on tasks and fight off ailments?\nI was somehow able to gather my focus and prevent doom-scrolling for the entire period at the library, which was around 2-3 hours. I hadn’t done that in a long long time, and it took every ounce of willpower I could muster. Later that evening I made the important realization that attention can be trained, and a few days later I decided to put some effort into maintaining my nascent daily coding habit. I told myself I would push at least 1 commit a day on any project, to outsiders a seemingly paltry amount.\nAt first I stuck to the bare minimum. At times I pushed off the single commit until 11:55pm. What happened next I never would have imagined. 2 months in, I started naturally pushing to do more and more with the various projects I had been working on. Pushing is the wrong word, rather, I was being pulled. I couldn’t stop myself.\nOne of the biggest benefits of deciding to code every day is that it has greatly fueled my creativity. This is because coding consistently and not forcing myself to live up to any standard gives me the freedom to fail consistently, and that organically grows my skills and comfort with being a producer. I always used to get writer’s block in school. Looking back, if I had kept up a daily practice of writing without expectations of quality, I would’ve saved so much time and become a better writer.\nAround 90 days in, my coding sessions started putting me in the flow state sporadically. I would sit down to work and fall into a state where I was intensely focused and knocking out several tasks, going from intention to immediate task completion over and over. When you get into this mode consistently, it becomes absolutely addicting. The dopamine rush of moving so fast on tasks rewires your brain such that good food, intimate relationships, traveling, and other things normal people enjoy become absolutely deprioritized.\nI forgot to mention one other factor that might have greatly contributed to my increased focus and productivity. I visited my ENT in October of 2024. I had been a long-time sufferer of sinusitis, and after having my condition addressed with the correct combination of antihistamines and steroids along with a daily nasal rinse, I could finally consistently breathe without obstruction for the first time in 15 years.\nNow, after having coded for 100 days straight and learning mountains of information through my honed focus and work ethic, I think health probably plays a big role in your success, and especially the absence of chronic debilitating conditions such as allergies. If you can’t breathe right, sleep well, and you feel lethargic all the time, do not listen to hustle culture and just push harder. When there’s a certain behavior you’d like to exhibit, and you find yourself falling short of it all the time, realize that it’s not your fault. If you take care of yourself in the right way, you will naturally become the person you intend to be."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As with most of us, I have been creating, updating, and sending resumes for a non-trivial amount of time. It all started with Microsoft Word. I first filled out all of my information using a friend’s resume as a template, and sent it off to be seen by absolutely nobody. With each passing rejection I would, at irregular intervals, make revisions, maybe alter the format or font a bit, adjust the verbiage to make sure the content never exceeded a page, and continue fishing in what were usually rough waters.\nEventually, as my technical skills grew along with my frustration at continually wasting time editing my resume with little to show in return, I began exploring ways to automate this process. I looked far and wide for the proverbial giants’ shoulders I could firmly step onto.\nI tried using various frameworks that could handle all the formatting with my content, and for years and years I struggled with bugs, troubleshooting, virtual environments, and sometimes all 3 at once. Finally, I found rxresu.me, which I warmly recommend to absolutely everyone. It handles all the formatting and allows just enough customization to accommodate any sort of experience or project one would include without losing its intuitive and enjoyable UI. You can check out my resume made by that tool if you click on ‘CV’ on the top-right."
