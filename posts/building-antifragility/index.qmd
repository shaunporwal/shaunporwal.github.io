I have always been interested in self-improvement and becoming a strong person. I think it arose spontaneously. When I was a toddler, I precociously learned advanced Hindi from my parents. They put me in the bath, and I said a phrase in hindi equivalent to *I'm drenched*, with the specific, correct word for *drenched*, rather than *wet*. Growing up I was the only one in my Indian-American peer group who could speak fluent Hindi. Everyone else failed to adopt their parents' mother tongue. I was able to learn and integrate with surprising speed and adherence.

later in my childhood, my parents, on one of our trips to India, brought me to a jewelry store, and I was waiting in the car with the driver as I always do. I did not know how to read and write, and so I started learning how from the signs in the market which usually had both the Hindi text and their English equivalents right underneath. I also routinely pestered the driver with questions if I couldn't figure anything out myself. I installed the Hindi keyboard on my phone soon after and began typing phrases and sentences. At one point, I only messaged my mom using Hindi characters even though it took about 10 times as long.

At some point, my attention shifted to athletics. Even though I'm a very mediocre athlete, I have persisted in some form my whole life. In elemntary school, I would run around, in middle school I joined track, and in high school I did cross country, track, and tennis on my own recreationally. I have maintained my running interests ever since, successfully completing the NYC Marathon last November and totaling almost 1400 miles in 2024.

In high school, I was obsessed with Eric Thomas, a motivational speaker who really *spoke* to my ethos. His motto was *you gotta want it as bad as you breathe*. At that time, he encouraged his followers to wake up at 4am and get all your work done before the world even wakes up. I did that for many months, my will bolstered by his daily 4am motivational video releases. One day, he didn't post, breaking his consistency, and that hurt me. I had counted on him that day, and he let me down. I soon fell out of the habit.

In elementary school, I started playing runescape which took over my life. I was obsessed with levelling up my stats, namely woodcutting, mining, and fishing. I worked hard, got full rune armor, and tried to accumulate as much capital as I could. I loved killing the Al Kharid scorpions, hanging out with my friends (virtually), and making strategic trades and deals. Around that same time I got addicted to Pokemon red/blue/yellow and silver/gold/crystal. Evolving my pokemon was a high unlike any other.

Aside from these activities, I spent my time in class (aside from doing work) creating a currency system we would use to trade goods. The system was based on the graphite you could remove from saratoga (or other branded) wooden pencils. The larger the graphite piece, the more you could trade it for. The system spread like wildfire, and I had multiple classes doing it. At some point, our teacher saw me messing with my pencils, and me if I wanted to wood-carve, I would have to do it at home, and soon our whole economy grinded to a halt.

in elementary school:
- I played runescape to build my character
- I played pokemon to level up
- I created a new currency system in my classes using led from wooden pencils that we would exchange for goods
- Started playing trumpet to enrich myself musically with my friends
- Read books

in middle school:
- started track club/running to improve myself
- joined the chess club to improve my mind
- joined the Study Island club to learn more vocab
- continued playing the trumpet
- read TONS of books

in high school:
- tried to take the hardest classes
- did cross country all 4 years and spring track 3 years
- spent a ton of my free time learning to play the violin
- started deadlifting to improve my physique
- watched Eric Thomas and Elliott Hulse
- read TONS of books


I always:
- help myself to the highest standard and did my Best
- hated myself when I couldnt' achieve what I saw my peers achieving
- was extremely self deprecating

- talk about how this shaped my personality, and how I've leveraged my previous selves to slowly become extrmely antifragile
- talk about taleb's book and relevant concepts
