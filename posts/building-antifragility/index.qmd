I have always been interested in self-improvement and becoming a strong person.


in elementary school:
- I played runescape to build my character
- I played pokemon to level up
- I created a new currency system in my classes using led from wooden pencils that we would exchange for goods
- Started playing trumpet to enrich myself musically with my friends
- Read books

in middle school:
- started track club/running to improve myself
- joined the chess club to improve my mind
- joined the Study Island club to learn more vocab
- continued playing the trumpet
- read TONS of books

in high school:
- tried to take the hardest classes
- did cross country all 4 years and spring track 3 years
- spent a ton of my free time learning to play the violin
- started deadlifting to improve my physique
- watched Eric Thomas and Elliott Hulse
- read TONS of books


I always:
- help myself to the highest standard and did my Best
- hated myself when I couldnt' achieve what I saw my peers achieving
- was extremely self deprecating

- talk about how this shaped my personality, and how I've leveraged my previous selves to slowly become extrmely antifragile
- talk about taleb's book and relevant concepts
