Here are some of the projects I've worked on in the past 100 days.

One of the biggest benefits of deciding to code every day is that it has greatly fueled my
creativity. This is because coding consistently and not forcing myself to live up to any standard
gives me the freedom to fail consistently, and that organically grows my skills and comfort with
being a producer.

I always used to get writer's block in school. Looking back, if I had kept up a daily practice of
writing without expectations of quality, I would've saved so much time and become a better writer.
