Since around November of last year, I've been in solitude, relatively speaking. I still hang out with a couple people now and then, but I developed a feeling of repulsion to superficial socializing. Of course when there's less time allocated in one area of life, it leaved a vacuum to be filled. As such, a commensurate dedication to mastery, building, and self-growth has taken the stage. It was a very natural processs, I just followed my gut. I don't even think I did anything volitionally, it was all very seamless and natural. Sometimes loneliness strikes, but I've gotten very good at being present and waiting out emotional storms, and so I feel in complete control.

I really enjoy having strong daily motivation to code, exercise, play the violin, exercise, and learn new things. This is the longest stretch of time I've maintained this exuberance in my life. I don't really know what's behind it. Maybe it's that I cleared house and now there are fewer engery sucks? Maybe it's the fact that my allergies and breathing are under control? Maybe it's because I don't have to stick to a rigid schedule, and can sleep as much as I want at whatever hour, and so in my waking hours I usually always feel fully rested? All of those sound plausible.

So anyways, what are new insights and discoveries I've made as I evolved into the person I am now? For one, I think it's vital to listen to internal frictions and act in ways that might lessen those. Other people might have their own judgements and desires, and it's important to separate from those and do what you think is right.


- Able to act without being influenced by others
- Decionditioning from society/thoughts of peers, parents, others
- Helped me follow my intuition more
- Allowed me to hone in on what I'm trying to become world class at because no more obligations
- Cleared up my priorities
- Had some 'friends' that would inadvertantly bring me into situations that would waste my time/energy, am now free 

- I used to have sinking feelings when I spent too much time alone, I don't know if it was through adaptation to solitude that made that go away or that I feel extremely driven
- I can better notice what my gut is telling me to do
