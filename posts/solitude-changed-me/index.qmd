Post about how retreating from society was extremely valuable to my growth


- Able to act without being influenced by others
- Decionditioning from society/thoughts of peers, parents, others
- Helped me follow my intuition more
- Allowed me to hone in on what I'm trying to become world class at because no more obligations
- Cleared up my priorities
- Had some 'friends' that would inadvertantly bring me into situations that would waste my time/energy, am now free 

- I used to have sinking feelings when I spent too much time alone, I don't know if it was through adaptation to solitude that made that go away or that I feel extremely driven
- I can better notice what my gut is telling me to do
