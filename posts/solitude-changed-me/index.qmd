Since around November of last year, I've been in solitude, relatively speaking. I still hang out with a couple people now and then, but I developed a feeling of repulsion to superficial socializing. Of course when there's less time allocated in one area of life, it leaved a vacuum to be filled. As such, a commensurate dedication to mastery, building, and self-growth has taken the stage. It was a very natural processs, I just followed my gut. I don't even think I did anything volitionally, it was all very seamless and natural. Sometimes loneliness strikes, but I've gotten very good at being present and waiting out emotional storms, and so I feel in complete control.

I really enjoy having strong daily motivation to code, exercise, play the violin, exercise, and learn new things. This is the longest stretch of time I've maintained this exuberance in my life. I don't really know what's behind it. Maybe it's that I cleared house and now there are fewer engery sucks? Maybe it's the fact that my allergies and breathing are under control? Maybe it's because I don't have to stick to a rigid schedule, and can sleep as much as I want at whatever hour, and so in my waking hours I usually always feel fully rested? All of those sound plausible.

So anyways, what are new insights and discoveries I've made as I evolved into the person I am now? For one, I think it's vital to listen to internal frictions and act in ways that might lessen those. Other people might have their own judgements and desires, and it's important to separate from those and do what your nervous system is telling you. The reason for this is clear. The fewer contradictions there are between the psyche, the body, and the external world, the less blockers there are to energy and the easier life becomes.

To give an example, if you really don't want to work because you're tired, and yet you force yourself to do something you're not feeling, your work will be half-assed. If, however, you heed your body's warning and rest and come back to your work when you feel like it, you will be able to focus longer and more intensely. Forcing the body to do what it doesn't want to will just lead to more fatigue and could affect the way you approach your work next time.


Using natural motivation to start up a daily practice of something small will create neural pathways that use endocannabinoids rather than dopamine. Endocannabinoids are neurotransmitters that are released from engaging in habits. They affect pleasure sensors, and make habits feel enjoyable to engage in. This makes it so that future repititions of habitual actions become the path of least resistance, and conversely, unfamiliar ways of being or effort beyond what's habitual are discouraged, neurologically speaking.


The advantage of starting and staying small for as long as possible, even if there's motivation to overachieve, is that with each repitition the foundation for a brain that can jump into a task at hand becomes more robust. The problem with overachieving is that it's too risky and may derail a practice. Overexertion works against establishing habits because it incentivizes subsequent rest. You want as much time under tension as possible for as long as possible. You want to lift 5 pounds a day, every day, for a whole year. Not 1825 lbs all at once. Who is going to win in the long term and over their lifespan, someone who works out a little bit every day? Or someone who works out every once in a while because they get so sore from their workouts that they can't comfortably maintain their effort?


- Able to act without being influenced by others
- Decionditioning from society/thoughts of peers, parents, others
- Helped me follow my intuition more
- Allowed me to hone in on what I'm trying to become world class at because no more obligations
- Cleared up my priorities
- Had some 'friends' that would inadvertantly bring me into situations that would waste my time/energy, am now free 

- I used to have sinking feelings when I spent too much time alone, I don't know if it was through adaptation to solitude that made that go away or that I feel extremely driven
- I can better notice what my gut is telling me to do
