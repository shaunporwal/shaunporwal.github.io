<h2>
<strong>Guidelines for Reporting of Statistics for Clinical Research in
Urology</strong>
</h2>
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30633111/" class="link">Link to
the article</a> <span class="year">06/16/23</span>
<p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I read this already, but just reading again to let these guidelines
sink in.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Comparing this to other papers I’ve read, it seems that there are
many different kinds of papers. There are research papers that report
data, analyses conducted, results, and conclusions. Then there are
papers that report guidelines like this one. Given the breadth of paper
paradigms, I wonder what kind of papers are not allowed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This kind of seems like an opinion piece with suggestions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2005 Scales et al. paper reports in the month that papers were
analyzed, 71% of papers with comparative stats had at least 1
statistical flaw. Now I have to look into this paper, but I wonder what
kind of flaws this paper is referring to. Would including an extra sig.
fig. for a result in a table constitute an error? If so, I think saying
71% of papers contain at least 1 flaw is disingenuous.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This Scales et al. paper should be next on my list of papers to
read.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I hate how pedantic statisticians can be about stats. One thing my
current boss did in my initial interview with him was ask me to define a
p-value. I got it wrong of course, because the true definition is ‘the
probability of obtaining observed data assuming that the null hypothesis
is true.’</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Guidelines to read</strong>:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>CONSORT for randomized trials</li>
<li>ReMARK for marker studies</li>
<li>TRIPOD for prediction models</li>

<h2>
<strong>On the Need for Landmark Analysis or Time-dependent
Covariates</strong>
</h2>
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37037013/" class="link">Link to
the article</a> <span class="year">06/15/23</span>
<p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> <Notes></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One of most common/serious stat errors: ignoring time dependency of
covariates in survival analyses (guideline 4.15)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Common survival analysis techniques, such as Cox regression or the
Kaplan-Meier method, assume that all covariates are known at the start
of follow-up</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>guarantee-time bias” (also known as immortal-time bias)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>landmark analysis technique is appropriate when the covariate of
interest is known within a relatively short period of time after the
start of follow-up</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>when performing a landmark analysis it is essential to report the
number of subjects excluded in each group because they experienced the
event of inter- est or were censored before the landmark, and the number
of subjects whose covariate status changed after the landmark.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>use of time-dependent covariates in Cox regression may be more
appropriate than the landmark analysis approach when the value of a co-
variate changes during follow-up, where there is not an obvious landmark
time, or when the use of a landmark time would lead to an unacceptable
number of exclu- sions</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Analysis of a time-dependent covariate in a Cox regression model
requires setup of a special- ized data set in a format known as counting
process format, in which patients may have multiple rows of data
corresponding to different time intervals.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If the changing value of a covariate over time is ignored, it is
likely that the proportional hazards assumption, upon which Cox
regression relies, is violated, which can lead to incorrect estimates
and conclusions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An important drawback of the time-dependent covariate approach is
that it cannot be used to generate prediction of survival over time, and
interpretation of the time- dependent coefficients can be
difficult.6,7</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Take Home points:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The use of traditional survival analysis methods such as Cox
regression or Kaplan-Meier analysis require that all covariates are
known at the start of follow-up and remain constant throughout the
follow-up period. - Covariates whose status changes during follow-up are
known as time-dependent covariates. When the time-de- pendency of
covariates is ignored Kaplan-Meier esti- mates are subject to
“guarantee-time bias” and the proportional hazards assumption of Cox
regression may be violated. - Cox regression can accommodate a
time-varying co- variate using a data set in the appropriate specialized
format. But this method cannot be used to generate sur- vival estimates.
- Landmark analysis is useful when the covariate of in- terest is known
within a relatively short period of time after the start of follow-up. A
fixed landmark time is selected and the start of follow-up and
covariates status is defined at the time of the landmark. This method
can be used to generate survival estimates, but requires exclusion of
patients who had the event or were censored prior to the landmark time.
- Analyses that do not appropriately handle time- dependent covariates
violate the assumptions of the standard survival analyses and
submissions that do not analyze time-dependent covariates appropri-
ately will not pass statistical review at The Journal of Urology!.</p>

<strong>Innovations in Statistical Review at European Urology</strong>
</h2>
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30327270/" class="link">Link to
the article</a> <span class="year">06/15/23</span>
<p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> <Notes></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>3 principles</strong>:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>we would develop systematic guidance for authors based on a review
of common errors in urology research</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>all papers with substantive statistics that were under serious
consideration for publication in European Urology would be reviewed by a
statistician</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>we would continue to innovate with respect to statistical
reporting.</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<p>The title is misleading because the paper is mostly about things
other than ‘innovations’. Even the ‘innovation’ they speak of is just
looking at code. Nothing really innovative going on.</p>

</h2>
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33629252/" class="link">Link to
the article</a> <span class="year">06/14/23</span>
<p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> <Notes></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Why are they using an acronym for enhanced recovery after surgery
(ERAS), seems stupid</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Does this REALLY need an acronym?: The postanesthesia care unit
(PACU)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When they say ‘…with a multivariable logistic regression model,
adjusting for age, BMI,…’, how do you adjust code-wise?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Again, exclusions in results, guess this is standard practice</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This table does not seem to be generated using gtsummary, there are
cells (maybe this is an option? )</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Vocab</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>perioperative</strong>: Perioperative refers to the entire
span of surgical management, including the preoperative (before
surgery), intraoperative (during surgery), and postoperative (after
surgery) phases.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Ketorolac</strong>: a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug
(NSAID) commonly used in Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)
protocols, inhibits cyclooxygenase, which may lead to slower bone
healing, compromised postoperative kidney function, and increased
perioperative bleeding.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>lumpectomy</strong>: lump removed from breast</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>contralateral mastectomy</strong>: A contralateral mastectomy
is a preventive surgery to remove the breast not affected by cancer to
reduce the risk of future breast cancer.</p>

<p><br> <strong>Notes:</strong> <Notes></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What is ‘matching nested’ and what is the ratio: Case-control study
with 1:3 matching nested</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What is the Vickers Team’s affiliation with Sweden? Seems like Emily
does a lot of work with Sweden too.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>They use LOWESS for non-linear relation between PSA and outcome,
could a GAM be used instead?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This exclusion, shouldn’t it be in the methods and not the results?:
We excluded one case (a man who died from prostate cancer)…</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Vocab</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>operating characteristics</strong>: Operating characteristics
of a medical test refer to its sensitivity, specificity, and predictive
values, which collectively indicate its ability to correctly identify
those with and without the disease (GPT definition)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>nested case-control design</strong>: A nested case-control
study is a type of observational research within a larger cohort study
that compares exposure to certain risk factors between those who develop
an outcome of interest (“cases”) and a subset of participants who did
not develop the outcome (“controls”).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>labile</strong>: easily altered</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>conditional logistic regression</strong>: Conditional
logistic regression is a statistical method used to examine the
relationship between a binary outcome and one or more independent
variables, while accounting for matching in case-control studies, like
testing the association between prostate specific antigen concentrations
and the occurrence of a certain condition in a prostate health
study.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>matching in case-control studies</strong>: Matching in
case-control studies is a process where each case (individual with a
condition) is paired with one or more controls (individuals without the
condition) who share similar characteristics, such as age or sex, to
help isolate the effect of the exposure being studied.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Lorenz Curve</strong>: In this study, the Lorenz curve is
used to visually represent the distribution of prostate cancer risk
across different prostate specific antigen concentrations, providing
insight into how much of the total estimated risk is accounted for by
different segments of the population.</p>

<strong>A Contemporary Prostate Cancer Grading System: A Validated
Alternative to the Gleason Score</strong>
</h2>
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26166626/" class="link">Link to
the article</a> <span class="year">06/13/23</span>
<p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> <Notes></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thought the whole point of CoxPH is to use multiple predictors, but
here we have ‘Separate univariable and multivariable Cox proportional
hazards used four possible categorizations of Gleason scores.’ Need to
look into this.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What is the difference between 3+4 &amp; 4+3? A Gleason score 7 can
represent mostly well-differentiated cancer with a lesser component of
more poorly differentiated cancer (Gleason 3 + 4 = 7) or mostly poorly
differentiated cancer with a smaller component of well-differentiated
cancer (4 + 3 = 7).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Interesting that there are no commas in numbers above 999 (e.g. 12
345)</p>

<strong>Blood prostate specific antigen levels at age 60</strong>
</h2>
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24682399/" class="link">Link to
the article</a> <span class="year">06/13/23</span>
<p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> <Notes></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Interesting Fact: PSA test was introduced in Sweden in the
mid-90s</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>EDTA: Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid: anticoagulating agent for
blood and used to remove heavy metals from blood/body</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This line, have to read up on the reference for it, would like to
understand how the PSA values were imputed: ‘Owing to the case-control
design of the Malmö Preventive Project (three controls matched to each
index case), blood was not sampled for some participants and we had to
impute their PSA values, using methods previously described’</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This line, have to look into how Nelson-Aalen is used to plot: ‘The
Nelson-Aalen method was used to plot the cumulative hazards for these
events.’</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Why do binomial methods allow for obtaining confidence intervals for
risk differences: ‘To obtain confidence intervals for risk differences,
we used binomial methods.’</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Need to really understand this line, not making sense right now:
‘Since there was greater censoring before 15 years in the Gothenburg
arm, and because event rates were positively correlated with PSA levels,
binomial methods bias against our hypothesis that the benefits of
screening are small for men with lower PSA levels.’</p>

<p>This makes sense, but need it laid out mathematically for more
clarity, and also the subsequent calculation for the # needed to be
diagnosed: ‘We calculated the number needed to screen as the inverse of
the absolute risk reduction between the screened and unscreened groups
based on 15 years of follow-up.’</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This paper also has results interspersed with figures/tables</p>

<strong>International Prostate Symptom Score Questionnaire</strong>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> <Notes></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One thing I noted was that the tables and figures are mixed in with
the results section, which I did not do for my first actual project. In
my project I grouped the tables and figures at the bottom.</p>
<p>Additionally, the tables and figures have shortner names that are
more to-the-point than mine, and they don’t have repeated information
such as the same exclusion criteria listed among all the
tables/figures.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I noticed that, again, the methods and results all flow together to
paint a picture that answers the initial research question
unequivocally, which is what I need to do in my papers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Criticisms</strong>:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Tables 1&amp;2, variables should be more distinct, and subcategories
should be indented further</li>
<li>‘The prevalence of discordance was highest for incomplete emptying
(24%)’ - I don’t see this 24% anywhere in tables</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> <Notes> <br> Abstract Parts: <br> 1.
Background <br> 2. Objective <br> 3. Design Setting and Participants
<br> 4. Outcome measurements and statitical analysis <br> 5. Results and
limitations <br> 6. Conclusions</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Key Words I didn’t know:</p>
<p><strong>discrete choice experiments</strong> (DCE),
<strong>conditional logit models</strong>, <strong>marginal rates of
substitution</strong> (MRS)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Discrete Choice Experiments</strong>: A way of quantifying
preferences through analyzing decisions made by participants.
Participants pick between competing scenarios with different
combinations of attributes from several categorical features.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Conditional Logit Models</strong>: A conditional logit model
is a statistical model used to examine and model the relationship
between a categorical dependent variable and one or more independent
variables. This is a specific type of logit model that is particularly
useful in cases where the dependent variable represents a choice, and
the aim is to understand how different attributes of the choices
influence the likelihood of each being selected.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The materials and methods has 4 sections: <strong>Expert
Panel</strong>, <strong>DCE survey design</strong>, <strong>study
participants</strong>, <strong>statistical analyses</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Marginal Rates of Substitution</strong>: These portray the
rates at which respondents are willing to trade their choices in one
attribute for preferred levels on another attribute</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>All in all, throughout the paper, the research question and the
methods used to answer the question remain lucid, and the results are a
cogent story that can give insights into the nature of the issue and
provides a normative statement based on that story.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Right now, because I don’t have a breadth or depth of knowledge in
the field, I lack the foundational knowledge to judge papers as
well/poorly written.</p>
