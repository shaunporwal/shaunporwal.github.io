<strong>Guidelines for Reporting of Figures and Tables for Clinical

<p><br></p>
<p>Only include figures if they importantly improve the reader’s ability
to understand the study findings. In my case in the Testis project, make
sure included Kaplan-Meier plots serve a purpose</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When including figures/plots, make sure that they give an immediate
visual impression that cannot be captured similary in some quick
words</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Good Kaplan-Meier advice: truncate follow-up time for KM figs when #
at risk &lt;5 (or even 10)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Interesting</strong>: Avoid repeating in the text the results
reported in the tables. Refer to all tables in the text by providing a
general summary or overall inter-pretation. <strong>This is a little
tricky because you have to know what the literature says to make the
interpretations</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This suggestion is directly relevant to my work on the testis
project, since I had to use ‘add_global_p’ to get the overall p-value
for the column, and not the individual predictors, in the multivariable
LR tables: For categorical variables, a single hypothesistest is
preferable to multiple tests at eachlevel of the category.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
<p>A good guideline: Don’t mention things that are unfalsifiable, as
they hold no value (e.g. “surgeons should carefully consider the extent
of surgery”)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Regarding statistical methods, each method should state specifically
what it is testing</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Literature review in discussion should only pertain to the the
findings and that’s it</p>

<p>Don’t just mention study limitations, but also explain the effects of
the study limitations. In this paper Andrew mentions: Discussion of
limitations should include both the likelihood and effect size of

<strong>Defining the Impact of Family History on Detection of High Grade

</h2>
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34980493/" class="link">Link to

<p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>

<p>Only read up to end of results</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The researchers used a statistical method called “multiple imputation
with chained equations” to fill in missing data for certain variables,
and then repeated their main analyses with this filled-in data to ensure
their results were not significantly influenced by these missing
values.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sensitivity analyses using multiple imputation seems to be a common
thing when evaluating how missingness affects analyses</p>

<h2>
<strong>A commentary on PSA velocity and doubling time for clinical
decisions in prostate cancer</strong>
</h2>
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24581521/" class="link">Link to
the article</a> <span class="year">06/20/23</span>
<p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Every sentence seems to be saying something unequivocally, and the
ideas flow from one to the next, need to include this in my writing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How to evaluate a marker: (1) Marker must be significantly different
between control and disease group, (2) Marker must add information not
previously known</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This sentence makes sense, but I want to make it click
instantaneously: Several groups have reported that PSA velocity fails to
improve the specificity of PSA for biopsy, that is, it does not help the
decision to biopsy men with elevated PSA.19-23</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The sentence above basically says that PSAV fails to improve
specificity for PSA for biopsy (doesn’t help decision to biopsy).
Basically, it doesn’t maximize the TP/(TP + FP). The FPs are still left
as is or worse.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Ask Andrew about this sentence</strong>: PSA velocity was not
found to improve the sensitivity of PSA: using high PSA velocity as a
criterion to biopsy men with low PSA would lead to many millions of
additional biopsies per year, without a correspondingly important
increase in the number of high-grade cancers detected.</p>
<p><strong>Regarding the above</strong>, it says PSAV not found to
increase sensitivity, but then it says it would lead to additional
biopsies without correspondingly important increase in # high-grade
cancers detected. The first part and second part don’t match, since the
second part implies that sensitivity is decreased. If that is the case,
why not just say that PSAV decreases sensitivity? If that isn’t the
case, then the second part is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew’s response</strong>: Additional biopsies have nothing
to do with the sensitivity since sensitivity only cares about total # of
prostate cancer,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How does use of randomized trial data avoid these issues: In clinical
co- horts, it might not be clear how a patient was referred, whether the
PSA record is complete, or what the criteria for biopsy were, leading to
problems such as verification bias. Use of randomized trial data avoids
these problems.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Answer to above: Randomized trials, through their design, control for
factors such as referral methods, biopsy criteria, and ensure complete
record-keeping, thereby reducing biases common in clinical cohorts.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>PSA Velocity should not be used to decide whether or not to
do a biopsy</strong>, as it will lead to many unnecessary procedures.
However, it can aid patient counselling in advanced disease stages. PSA
changes (high velocity) while on treatment for advanced diease can
indicate disease resistance to treatment.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Vocab</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>PSA Velocity</strong>: PSA velocity is a term used to
describe the rate of change in PSA levels over time. Specifically, it’s
a measure of how rapidly PSA levels increase within a specific
period.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC)</strong>:
plotting TPR vs FPR for single classifier at a variety of thresholds</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>risk count method for calculating PSA</strong>: Can’t find
this definition anywhere</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>verification bias</strong>: occurs during investigations of
diagnostic test accuracy when there is a difference in testing strategy
between groups of individuals, leading to differing ways of verifying
the disease of interest</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Standard Arms</strong>: In the context of clinical trials,
“standard arms” refers to the control groups that receive the currently
accepted and widely used treatment for a condition.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer</strong>: also
known as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), is a form of
prostate cancer that continues to progress despite the use of hormone
therapy.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>concordance index</strong>: a measure used in statistics to
assess the predictive accuracy of a model, especially in the context of
survival analysis or in scenarios where outcomes are ordered (such as
risk scores). It is a generalization of the area under the Receiver
Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which is a graphical plot that
illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system.</p>

<strong>Comparison between the four-kallikrein panel and Prostate Health

</h2>
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4503229/" class="link">Link

<p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I never knew measuring total PSA produced an excess number of false
positives</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Just defining sensitivity and specificity below since I always forget
their defns and which one is which</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>re this line in paper: ‘High-grade cancer was defined as Gleason
score ≥7’, this is gleason score of 3+4 or higher, but there is debate
around 3+4 being high grade. 4+3, however, is definitely high-grade</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>re this line: Briefly, decision curve analysis graphically
illustrates the net benefit obtained by using the predictive models in a
patient by assuming that the threshold probability for having all
prostate cancer or highgrade prostate cancer at which a patient would
opt for biopsy is informative of how the patient weighs the relative
harms of a false-positive and a <strong>false-negative
prediction</strong>. <strong>How does DCA take into account false
negatives?</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In this paper, figures/tables at the end. Seems w.r.t. format there’s
leeway.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Vocab</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Sensitivity</strong>: Sensitivity (also called the true
positive rate, the recall, or probability of detection in some fields)
measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly
identified as such. In other words, it’s a measure of how well a test
correctly identifies a condition when that condition is indeed
present.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Specificity</strong>: Specificity (also called the true
negative rate) measures the proportion of actual negatives that are
correctly identified as such. That is, it’s a measure of how well a test
identifies the absence of a condition.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>discrimination</strong>: This is the ability of a predictive
model to differentiate between positive cases and negative cases. In
other words, it’s a measure of how well the model can distinguish or
‘discriminate’ between those who have an event or condition and those
who do not. A commonly used statistic for measuring discrimination is
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). A
perfect model has a discrimination of 1, while a model that performs no
better than random chance has a discrimination of 0.5 when using
AUC-ROC.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>calibration</strong>: This refers to the agreement between
predicted probabilities of an event and the observed frequencies of the
event. A model is said to be well-calibrated if the probabilities it
predicts correspond well with the actual outcome frequencies. For
example, among patients who are all predicted to have a 30% chance of a
disease, about 30% of them should actually have the disease for the
model to be well-calibrated. Calibration can be assessed visually using
a calibration plot or more formally using statistics like the Brier
score or the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.</p>

<strong>Guidelines for Reporting of Statistics for Clinical Research in
Urology</strong>
</h2>

the article</a> <span class="year">06/16/23</span>
<p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I read this already, but just reading again to let these guidelines
sink in.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Comparing this to other papers I’ve read, it seems that there are
many different kinds of papers. There are research papers that report
data, analyses conducted, results, and conclusions. Then there are
papers that report guidelines like this one. Given the breadth of paper
paradigms, I wonder what kind of papers are not allowed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This kind of seems like an opinion piece with suggestions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2005 Scales et al. paper reports in the month that papers were
analyzed, 71% of papers with comparative stats had at least 1
statistical flaw. Now I have to look into this paper, but I wonder what
kind of flaws this paper is referring to. Would including an extra sig.
fig. for a result in a table constitute an error? If so, I think saying
71% of papers contain at least 1 flaw is disingenuous.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This Scales et al. paper should be next on my list of papers to
read.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I hate how pedantic statisticians can be about stats. One thing my
current boss did in my initial interview with him was ask me to define a
p-value. I got it wrong of course, because the true definition is ‘the
probability of obtaining observed data assuming that the null hypothesis
is true.’</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Guidelines to read</strong>:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>CONSORT for randomized trials</li>
<li>ReMARK for marker studies</li>
<li>TRIPOD for prediction models</li>
<li>STROBE for observational studies</li>
<li>AMSTAR for systematic reviews</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Guideline 3.5 is interesting</strong>: the more p-values from
testings you have, the commensurately higher the probability that you
falsely rejected at least one of them.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This carries with it the implicit recommendation that you should
prioritize on # of questions, and for each question use only 1 p-value
(guideline 3.6/7)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One thing I need to get into the habit of doing is this: when
reporting p-values, be clear about which test the p-value is
testing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Typo</strong>: For instance, outcomes can be <strong>compared
either side of several different cut-points</strong>, and the optimal
cut-point chosen as the one associated with the smallest p-value.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Read up to and including 4.14. Too many guidelines, will come
back to this later.</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Vocab</strong></p>

<p><strong>umbrella trials</strong>: clin trial to test how well a new
substances works on patients with single type of cancer, but different

<h2>
<strong>On the Need for Landmark Analysis or Time-dependent
Covariates</strong>
</h2>
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37037013/" class="link">Link to
the article</a> <span class="year">06/15/23</span>
<p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> <Notes></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>One of most common/serious stat errors: ignoring time dependency of
covariates in survival analyses (guideline 4.15)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Common survival analysis techniques, such as Cox regression or the
Kaplan-Meier method, assume that all covariates are known at the start
of follow-up</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>guarantee-time bias” (also known as immortal-time bias)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>landmark analysis technique is appropriate when the covariate of
interest is known within a relatively short period of time after the
start of follow-up</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>when performing a landmark analysis it is essential to report the
number of subjects excluded in each group because they experienced the
event of inter- est or were censored before the landmark, and the number
of subjects whose covariate status changed after the landmark.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>use of time-dependent covariates in Cox regression may be more
appropriate than the landmark analysis approach when the value of a co-
variate changes during follow-up, where there is not an obvious landmark
time, or when the use of a landmark time would lead to an unacceptable
number of exclu- sions</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Analysis of a time-dependent covariate in a Cox regression model
requires setup of a special- ized data set in a format known as counting
process format, in which patients may have multiple rows of data
corresponding to different time intervals.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If the changing value of a covariate over time is ignored, it is
likely that the proportional hazards assumption, upon which Cox
regression relies, is violated, which can lead to incorrect estimates
and conclusions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An important drawback of the time-dependent covariate approach is
that it cannot be used to generate prediction of survival over time, and
interpretation of the time- dependent coefficients can be
difficult.6,7</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Take Home points:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The use of traditional survival analysis methods such as Cox
regression or Kaplan-Meier analysis require that all covariates are
known at the start of follow-up and remain constant throughout the
follow-up period. - Covariates whose status changes during follow-up are
known as time-dependent covariates. When the time-de- pendency of
covariates is ignored Kaplan-Meier esti- mates are subject to
“guarantee-time bias” and the proportional hazards assumption of Cox
regression may be violated. - Cox regression can accommodate a
time-varying co- variate using a data set in the appropriate specialized
format. But this method cannot be used to generate sur- vival estimates.
- Landmark analysis is useful when the covariate of in- terest is known
within a relatively short period of time after the start of follow-up. A
fixed landmark time is selected and the start of follow-up and
covariates status is defined at the time of the landmark. This method
can be used to generate survival estimates, but requires exclusion of
patients who had the event or were censored prior to the landmark time.
- Analyses that do not appropriately handle time- dependent covariates
violate the assumptions of the standard survival analyses and
submissions that do not analyze time-dependent covariates appropri-
ately will not pass statistical review at The Journal of Urology!.</p>

<p><strong>operating characteristics</strong>: Operating characteristics
of a medical test refer to its sensitivity, specificity, and predictive
values, which collectively indicate its ability to correctly identify
those with and without the disease (GPT definition)</p>

<p><strong>conditional logistic regression</strong>: Conditional
logistic regression is a statistical method used to examine the
relationship between a binary outcome and one or more independent
variables, while accounting for matching in case-control studies, like
testing the association between prostate specific antigen concentrations
and the occurrence of a certain condition in a prostate health
study.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>matching in case-control studies</strong>: Matching in
case-control studies is a process where each case (individual with a

<strong>A Contemporary Prostate Cancer Grading System: A Validated

<p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> <Notes></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Thought the whole point of CoxPH is to use multiple predictors, but
here we have ‘Separate univariable and multivariable Cox proportional
hazards used four possible categorizations of Gleason scores.’ Need to
look into this.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What is the difference between 3+4 &amp; 4+3? A Gleason score 7 can
represent mostly well-differentiated cancer with a lesser component of
more poorly differentiated cancer (Gleason 3 + 4 = 7) or mostly poorly
differentiated cancer with a smaller component of well-differentiated
cancer (4 + 3 = 7).</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> <Notes></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Interesting Fact: PSA test was introduced in Sweden in the
mid-90s</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>EDTA: Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid: anticoagulating agent for
blood and used to remove heavy metals from blood/body</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This line, have to read up on the reference for it, would like to
understand how the PSA values were imputed: ‘Owing to the case-control
design of the Malmö Preventive Project (three controls matched to each
index case), blood was not sampled for some participants and we had to
impute their PSA values, using methods previously described’</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This line, have to look into how Nelson-Aalen is used to plot: ‘The
Nelson-Aalen method was used to plot the cumulative hazards for these
events.’</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Why do binomial methods allow for obtaining confidence intervals for
risk differences: ‘To obtain confidence intervals for risk differences,
we used binomial methods.’</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Need to really understand this line, not making sense right now:
‘Since there was greater censoring before 15 years in the Gothenburg
arm, and because event rates were positively correlated with PSA levels,
binomial methods bias against our hypothesis that the benefits of
screening are small for men with lower PSA levels.’</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This makes sense, but need it laid out mathematically for more
clarity, and also the subsequent calculation for the # needed to be
diagnosed: ‘We calculated the number needed to screen as the inverse of
the absolute risk reduction between the screened and unscreened groups
based on 15 years of follow-up.’</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This paper also has results interspersed with figures/tables</p>
