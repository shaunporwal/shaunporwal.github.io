This page will house readings & reflections

My boss Andrew Vickers wants me to read 2 papers from our group each day. I will keep a record of my readings and reflections here. All articles obtained by searching my teammates' names on Google Scholar or NCBI (Andrew Vickers, Melissa Assel, Amy Tin, Emily Vertosick, Dan Sjoberg).

<strong>Notes:</strong> <Notes>

One thing I noted was that the tables and figures are mixed in with the results section, which I did not do for my first actual project. In my project I grouped the tables and figures at the bottom.

Additionally, the tables and figures have shortner names that are more to-the-point than mine, and they don't have repeated information such as the same exclusion criteria listed among all the tables/figures.

<br>

I noticed that, again, the methods and results all flow together to paint a picture that answers the initial research question unequivocally, which is what I need to do in my papers.

<br>

<strong>Criticisms</strong>:

1. Tables 1&2, variables should be more distinct, and subcategories should be indented further
2. 'The prevalence of discordance was highest for incomplete emptying (24%)' - I don't see this 24% anywhere in tables

Abstract Parts:

1. Background
<br>
2. Objective

3. Design Setting and Participants

5. Results and limitations
<br>
6. Conclusions

Key Words I didn't know:

<strong>discrete choice experiments</strong> (DCE), <strong>conditional logit models</strong>, <strong>marginal rates of substitution</strong> (MRS)

<br>

<strong>Discrete Choice Experiments</strong>: A way of quantifying preferences through analyzing decisions made by participants. Participants pick between competing scenarios with different combinations of attributes from several categorical features.

<br>

<strong>Conditional Logit Models</strong>: A conditional logit model is a statistical model used to examine and model the relationship between a categorical dependent variable and one or more independent variables. This is a specific type of logit model that is particularly useful in cases where the dependent variable represents a choice, and the aim is to understand how different attributes of the choices influence the likelihood of each being selected.

<br>

The materials and methods has 4 sections: <strong>Expert Panel</strong>, <strong>DCE survey design</strong>, <strong>study participants</strong>, <strong>statistical analyses</strong>

<br>

<strong>Marginal Rates of Substitution</strong>: These portray the rates at which respondents are willing to trade their choices in one attribute for preferred levels on another attribute

<br>

All in all, throughout the paper, the research question and the methods used to answer the question remain lucid, and the results are a cogent story that can give insights into the nature of the issue and provides a normative statement based on that story.

<br>

Right now, because I don't have a breadth or depth of knowledge in the field, I lack the foundational knowledge to judge papers as well/poorly written.
