This page will house readings & reflections

My boss Andrew Vickers wants me to read 2 papers from our group each day. I will keep a record of my readings and reflections here. All articles obtained by searching my teammates' names on Google Scholar or NCBI (Andrew Vickers, Melissa Assel, Amy Tin, Emily Vertosick, Dan Sjoberg).

<h2><strong>Intraoperative Ketorolac Associated with Risk of Reoperation After Mastectomy</strong></h2>
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33629252/" class="link">Link to the article</a>
<span class="year">06/14/23</span>
<p> 

<br>

<strong>Notes:</strong> <Notes>

<br>

Why are they using an acronym for enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS), seems stupid

<br>

Does this REALLY need an acronym?: The postanesthesia care unit (PACU) 

<br>

When they say '...with a multivariable logistic regression model, adjusting for age, BMI,...',
how do you adjust code-wise?

<br>

Again, exclusions in results, guess this is standard practice

<br>

This table does not seem to be generated using gtsummary, there are cells (maybe this is an option? )

<br>

<strong>Vocab</strong>

<br>

<strong>perioperative</strong>: Perioperative refers to the entire span of surgical management, including the preoperative (before surgery), intraoperative (during surgery), and postoperative (after surgery) phases.

<br>

<strong>Ketorolac</strong>: a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used in Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols, inhibits cyclooxygenase, which may lead to slower bone healing, compromised postoperative kidney function, and increased perioperative bleeding.

<br>

<strong>lumpectomy</strong>: lump removed from breast

<br>

<strong>contralateral mastectomy</strong>: A contralateral mastectomy is a preventive surgery to remove the breast not affected by cancer to reduce the risk of future breast cancer.

<h2><strong>PSA concentration at age 60 and death/metastasis from PCa: case-control study</strong></h2>
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20843935/" class="link">Link to the article</a>
<span class="year">06/14/23</span>
<p> 
<br>
<strong>Notes:</strong> <Notes>

<br>

What is 'matching nested' and what is the ratio: Case-control study with 1:3 matching nested

<br>


What is the Vickers Team's affiliation with Sweden? Seems like Emily does a lot of work with Sweden too.

<br>

They use LOWESS for non-linear relation between PSA and outcome, could a GAM be used instead?

<br>

This exclusion, shouldn't it be in the methods and not the results?: We excluded one case (a man who died from prostate cancer)... 

<br>

<strong>Vocab</strong>

<br>

<strong>operating characteristics</strong>: Operating characteristics of a medical test refer to its sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values, which collectively indicate its ability to correctly identify those with and without the disease (GPT definition)

<br>

<strong>nested case-control design</strong>: A nested case-control study is a type of observational research within a larger cohort study that compares exposure to certain risk factors between those who develop an outcome of interest ("cases") and a subset of participants who did not develop the outcome ("controls").

<br>

<strong>labile</strong>: easily altered

<br>

<strong>conditional logistic regression</strong>: Conditional logistic regression is a statistical method used to examine the relationship between a binary outcome and one or more independent variables, while accounting for matching in case-control studies, like testing the association between prostate specific antigen concentrations and the occurrence of a certain condition in a prostate health study.

<br>

<strong>matching in case-control studies</strong>: Matching in case-control studies is a process where each case (individual with a condition) is paired with one or more controls (individuals without the condition) who share similar characteristics, such as age or sex, to help isolate the effect of the exposure being studied.

<br>

<strong>Lorenz Curve</strong>: In this study, the Lorenz curve is used to visually represent the distribution of prostate cancer risk across different prostate specific antigen concentrations, providing insight into how much of the total estimated risk is accounted for by different segments of the population.

<h2><strong>A Contemporary Prostate Cancer Grading System: A Validated Alternative to the Gleason Score</strong></h2>
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26166626/" class="link">Link to the article</a>
<span class="year">06/13/23</span>
<p> 

<br>

<strong>Notes:</strong> <Notes>

<br>

Thought the whole point of CoxPH is to use multiple predictors, but here we have 'Separate univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards used four possible categorizations of Gleason scores.' Need to look into this.

<br>

What is the difference between 3+4 & 4+3? A Gleason score 7 can represent mostly well-differentiated cancer with a lesser component of more poorly differentiated cancer (Gleason 3 + 4 = 7) or mostly poorly differentiated cancer with a smaller component of well-differentiated cancer (4 + 3 = 7).

<br>

Interesting that there are no commas in numbers above 999 (e.g. 12 345)

<br>

Typically, BCR defined as post-op PSA value ≥0.2 ng/ml

<h2><strong>Blood prostate specific antigen levels at age 60</strong></h2>
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24682399/" class="link">Link to the article</a>
<span class="year">06/13/23</span>
<p> 

<br>

<strong>Notes:</strong> <Notes>

<br>

Interesting Fact: PSA test was introduced in Sweden in the mid-90s

<br>

EDTA: Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid: anticoagulating agent for blood and used to remove heavy metals from blood/body

<br>

This line, have to read up on the reference for it, would like to understand how the PSA values were imputed: 'Owing to the case-control design of the Malmö Preventive Project (three controls matched to each index case), blood was not sampled for some participants and we had to impute their PSA values, using methods previously described'

<br>

This line, have to look into how Nelson-Aalen is used to plot: 'The Nelson-Aalen method was used to plot the cumulative hazards for these events.'

<br>

Why do binomial methods allow for obtaining confidence intervals for risk differences: 'To obtain confidence intervals for risk differences, we used binomial methods.'

<br>

Need to really understand this line, not making sense right now: 'Since there was greater censoring before 15 years in the Gothenburg arm, and because event rates were positively correlated with PSA levels, binomial methods bias against our hypothesis that the benefits of screening are small for men with lower PSA levels.'

<br>

This makes sense, but need it laid out mathematically for more clarity, and also the subsequent calculation for the # needed to be diagnosed: 'We calculated the number needed to screen as the inverse of the absolute risk reduction between the screened and unscreened groups based on 15 years of follow-up.'

<br>

This paper also has results interspersed with figures/tables

<br>

Only read up till discussion (including M&R), did not read discussion

<h2><strong>International Prostate Symptom Score Questionnaire</strong></h2>
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37213479/" class="link">Link to the article</a>
<span class="year">06/12/23</span>
<p> 

<br>

<strong>Notes:</strong> <Notes>

<br>

One thing I noted was that the tables and figures are mixed in with the results section, which I did not do for my first actual project. In my project I grouped the tables and figures at the bottom.

Additionally, the tables and figures have shortner names that are more to-the-point than mine, and they don't have repeated information such as the same exclusion criteria listed among all the tables/figures.

<br>

I noticed that, again, the methods and results all flow together to paint a picture that answers the initial research question unequivocally, which is what I need to do in my papers.

<br>

<strong>Criticisms</strong>:

<br>

1. Tables 1&2, variables should be more distinct, and subcategories should be indented further
2. 'The prevalence of discordance was highest for incomplete emptying (24%)' - I don't see this 24% anywhere in tables

<h2><strong>Cancer Label Impact on Low Grade Prostate Cancer</strong></h2>
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37285311/" class="link">Link to the article</a>
<span class="year">06/12/23</span>
<p> 
<strong>Notes:</strong> <Notes>
<br>
Abstract Parts: 
<br>
1. Background
<br>
2. Objective
<br>
3. Design Setting and Participants
<br>
4. Outcome measurements and statitical analysis
<br>
5. Results and limitations
<br>
6. Conclusions

<br>

Key Words I didn't know:

<strong>discrete choice experiments</strong> (DCE), <strong>conditional logit models</strong>, <strong>marginal rates of substitution</strong> (MRS)

<br>

<strong>Discrete Choice Experiments</strong>: A way of quantifying preferences through analyzing decisions made by participants. Participants pick between competing scenarios with different combinations of attributes from several categorical features.

<br>

<strong>Conditional Logit Models</strong>: A conditional logit model is a statistical model used to examine and model the relationship between a categorical dependent variable and one or more independent variables. This is a specific type of logit model that is particularly useful in cases where the dependent variable represents a choice, and the aim is to understand how different attributes of the choices influence the likelihood of each being selected.

<br>

The materials and methods has 4 sections: <strong>Expert Panel</strong>, <strong>DCE survey design</strong>, <strong>study participants</strong>, <strong>statistical analyses</strong>

<br>

<strong>Marginal Rates of Substitution</strong>: These portray the rates at which respondents are willing to trade their choices in one attribute for preferred levels on another attribute

<br>

All in all, throughout the paper, the research question and the methods used to answer the question remain lucid, and the results are a cogent story that can give insights into the nature of the issue and provides a normative statement based on that story.

<br>

Right now, because I don't have a breadth or depth of knowledge in the field, I lack the foundational knowledge to judge papers as well/poorly written.
